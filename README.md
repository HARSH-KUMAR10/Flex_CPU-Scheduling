# Flex_CPU-Scheduling
**Efficiency Optimization CPU Scheduling Algorithms Through Visualization Using Gantt Charts.**
We have designed a pretty self explanatory project in which you can just click on the index.html file and run all the algorithms on merely just a click.
Once the index.html file opens you'll see different buttons for different algorithms such as FCFS, SJF etc and in some of them you'll find drop downs where you can select the type of the algorithm (Preemptive or Non-preemptive).
We have selected the following algorithms :
1. FCFS
2. LJF
3. SJF - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
4. RR
5. HRRN
