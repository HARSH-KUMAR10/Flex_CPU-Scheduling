# Flex_CPU-Scheduling
**Efficiency Optimization CPU Scheduling Algorithms Through Visualization Using Gantt Charts.**

**AIM :**

Visualization of the discovered patterns is important in order to communicate information efficiently and quickly using tables, charts, rules, decision trees etc hence our aim was to create a prototype which can Visualize the different algorithms and can compare the Efficiency of the Algorithms By analyzing the patterns using the same data set through Gantt Charts.
Our Project is handier for teachers to improve and easier for learners to grasp by taking advantages of JavaScript.
This Project is merely a prototype which can make research projects easier as it would not require to manually calculate the things.

We have employed the following algorithms in our Visualizer :
1. FCFS
2. LJF
3. SJF - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
4. RR
5. HRRN

**Guidelines To Execute The Project :**

We have designed a pretty self explanatory project in which you can just click on the index.html file and run all the algorithms on merely just a click.
1. Once the index.html file opens you'll see different buttons for different algorithms such as FCFS, SJF etc and in SJF you'll also find a drop down where you can select the type of the algorithm (Preemptive or Non-preemptive). 
2. Once you select an alogrithm, a page will appear where you'll have to input the arrival times and the burst times of the number of processes you want.
3. After entering the input you'll have to click on the Get BUTTON which will lead to a table being displayed with the process IDs, Burst time, Arrival Time, Waiting Time, Completion Time and Turn Around Time. Along with the table The AVERAGE Waiting Time And AVERAGE Turn Around Time will also appear with the Gantt Chart which would be visible in the CANVAS Box just below it.

**We have also attached the screenshots of the working prototype within this repository.**
